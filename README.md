# CNSD2024

CNSD Code Base for 2024 Batches

Cloud-native architecture is the design or plan for applications and services built specifically to exist in the cloud.  The “Cloud Native Solution Design” course will help the decision-makers cut through all the haze and effectively architect such a solution. The participants will learn to design and rapidly provision cloud-native solutions, a collection of small independent and loosely coupled services.

Participants will learn to incorporate various scaling design options. Participants will learn about polyglot persistence and NoSQL services. The course also discusses microservices suitability aspects, native design aspects, application migration from traditional hosting, container engineering, service cataloguing, pricing strategy,  security, privacy, storage and persistence options, governance, and service delivery mechanism.

This course is part of the Software Systems series and Graduate Certificate in Architecting Scalable Systems series offered by NUS-ISS.
